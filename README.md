# Django CRUD App Items and Images

This is my "Family Manager web application project", built as part of the CODERHOUSE ACT 3 course by Tadeo Miranda.

**Current Status (Feb 13, 2023):** The user interface, pages, buttons, and other components are still in active development (**|||nvmnd im not going to touch this code again on my life so IT IS WHAT IT IS|||**). The initial START button doesn't yet have functionality. Please feel free to navigate using the navigation bar. You can explore the "Family" section to test the CRUD app.

## Project Overview

You can create, read, update and delate items w title, description, image and that stuff...
